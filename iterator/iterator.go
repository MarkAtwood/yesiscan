// SkipPath takes an input path and file info struct, and returns whether we
// should skip over it or not. To skip it, return true and no error. To skip a
// directory, return interfaces.SkipDir as the error. Lastly, if anything goes
// wrong, you can return your own error, but minimizing this chance is ideal.
// The stuff that gets skipped in here *must* be common for all iterators, as
// this function is shared by all of them. Individual backends can have their
// own file skip detection as well. For example, one particular backend might
// not know how to scan *.go files, where as a different one might specialize in
// this. Lastly, a design decision was made to make this a "pure, stateless"
// function. In other words, the decision to skip a file or not should be based
// entirely on the input arguments, and more complicated skip functions that
// might take into account more complex logic, such as the existence of multiple
// file paths is not possible. For example, if someone were to invent a file
// called `.legalignore` that worked like `.gitignore` but told software which
// files copyrights wouldn't apply from, we'd be unable to detect those and skip
// over them with this skip function since it only has a view into individual
// files and doesn't get a stateful, full directory tree view.
